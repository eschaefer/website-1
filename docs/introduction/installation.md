## Installation

Install with npm or Yarn.

<pre>
npm i <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/hyperapp">hyperapp</a>
</pre>

Then with a module bundler like [Rollup](https://github.com/rollup/rollup) or [Webpack](https://github.com/webpack/webpack), use as you would anything else.

```jsx
import { h, app } from "hyperapp"
```

Or download directly from [unpkg](https://unpkg.com/hyperapp), [jsDelivr](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/hyperapp@latest/dist/hyperapp.js), or [CDNJS](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/hyperapp).

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/hyperapp"></script>
```

Then find it in `window.hyperapp`.

```jsx
const { h, app } = hyperapp
```
